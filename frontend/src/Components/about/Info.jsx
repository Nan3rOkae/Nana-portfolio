          I developed a web application with a team that teaches users about internet
          security through interactive means. I used Full Stack web development
          technologies (React.js, Express.js, Node.js, and Git) to build the
          application and participated in agile practices like daily stand-ups
          and weekly sprint demo meetings. I also received mentorship from
          software engineering professionals at Salesforce.
